/**
 * truncateAll — clear every mutable table between integration tests.
 *
 * Iterates child → parent so foreign keys hold without disabling them.
 * Static catalog tables are preserved:
 *   - `Permissions` — seeded by migrations 0018 / 0019 / 0022 and queried
 *     on every permission check.
 *   - `Roles`       — the seven built-in roles seeded by migration 0018.
 *   - `RolePermissions` — the role→permission grants seeded by 0018+.
 * Wiping any of these would silently strip the workspace-owner role of
 * `workspace.delete` (and similar) so freshly-created workspaces would
 * 403 their own owners.
 *
 * Uses DELETE rather than TRUNCATE TABLE because TRUNCATE is forbidden on
 * tables referenced by FKs (which most of these are). DELETE is slower but
 * works without dropping/recreating constraints.
